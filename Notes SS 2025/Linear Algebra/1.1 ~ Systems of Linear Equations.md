## Linear Equations
A linear equation in the variables $x_{1}$...$x_{n}$ is an equation that can be written in the form:
$$
a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} + \dots + a_{n}x_{n} = b
$$
where $b$ and the coefficients $a_1$...$a_{n}$ are real or complex numbers, usually known in advance. The subscript $n$ may be any positive integer. In textbook examples and exercises, $n$ is normally between 2 and 5. In real life problems, $n$ might be 50 or 5000, or even larger.
#### Examples of Linear Equations:

The following equations are both linear because they can be arranged algebraically as shown:
$$
4x_{1} - 5x_{2} + 2 = x_{1} \text{ and } x_{2} = 2(\sqrt{ 6 }-x_{1}) + x_{3}
$$
becomes:
$$
3x_{1}-5x_{2}=-2 \text{ and }2x_{1} + x_{2} - x_{3} = 2\sqrt{ 6 }
$$
#### Examples of Nonlinear Equations:
The following equations are not linear because of the presence of $x_{1}x_{2}$ in the first equation and $\sqrt{ x_{1} }$ in the second:
$$
4x_{1} - 5x_{2} = x_{1}x_{2} 
$$
$$
x_{2} = 2\sqrt{ x_{1} }-6
$$

## Systems of Linear Equations (linear system)
A system of linear equations (or a linear system) is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables - say, $x_{1}\dots x_{n}$. An example is:
$$
2x_{1}-x_{2}+1.5x_{3}=8
$$
$$
x_{1} - 4x_{3} = -7
$$

#### Solutions to Linear Equations
A solution of the system is a list $(s_{1},s_{2},\dots,s_{n})$ of numbers that makes each equation a true statement for when the  values of $s_{1}\dots s_{n}$ are substituted for $x_{1}\dots x_{n}$ respectively. 

For instance, (5, 6.5, 3) is a solution of the above system because when these values are substituted for $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$, respectively, the equations simplify to $8=8$ and $-7 = -7$.

There could be no solutions to a system of linear equations, exactly one solution, or infinitely many:

A system of linear equations is said to be consistent if it has either one solution or infinitely many solutions, and inconsistent if it has no solutions.

## Matrix Notation
The essential information of a linear system can be recorded compactly in a rectangular array called a matrix. Given the following system:
$$
x_{1}-2x_{2}+x_{3}=0
$$
$$
2x_{2}-8x_{3}=8
$$
$$
5x_{1} - 5x_{3} = 10
$$
with the coefficients of each variable aligned in columns, the following matrix is called the coefficient matrix (matrix of coefficients):
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 \\
0 & 2 & -8 \\
5 & 0 & -5
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and this matrix is called the augmented matrix of the system:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -8 & 8 \\
5 & 0 & -5 & 10 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

An augmented matrix of a system consists of the coefficient matrix with an added column containing the constants from the right sides of the equations. 

## Solving a Linear System
The basic strategy is to replace one system with an equivalent system (i.e., one with the same solution set) that is easier to solve.

Use the $x_{1}$ term in the first equation of a system to eliminate $x_{1}$ terms in the other equations. Then, use the $x_{2}$ term in the second equation to eliminate the $x_{2}$ terms in the other equations, and so on, until you finally obtain a very simple equivalent system of equations.
