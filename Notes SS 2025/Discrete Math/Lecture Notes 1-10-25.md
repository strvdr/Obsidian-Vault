### Implication: If vs. Only If
Consider:
1. I wear a hat only **if** it's sunny
$$
B \implies A
$$
2. I wear a hat **only if** it's sunny
$$
A \implies B
$$
3. I wear a hat **whenever** it's sunny
$$
B \implies A
$$
### Truth Table Implication
There are 3 related conditional statements related to the implication
$$
A \implies B
$$
Converse:
$$
B \implies A
$$
Inverse:
$$
\neg A \implies \neg B
$$
Contrapositive: 
$$
\neg B \implies \neg A
$$
	*** When the implication $A \implies B$ is true, so is the contrapositive ***

### Definitions
1. **Tautology**: A tautology is a proposition which is always true.
$$
p \vee \neg p
$$

### Propositional Satisfiability
1. **Satisfiable**: A compound proposition is satisfiable if there is an assignment of truth values to its variables that make it true. If no such assignment exists, the compound proposition is unsatisfiable. a

### Logical Equivalences
**Logically Equivalent**: Two compound propositions $p$ and $q$ are logically equivalent if $p \iff q$ is a tautology. Denoted $p\equiv q$.

#### Logical Equivalence Laws:
1. DeMorgan's Laws
$$
\neg(q \wedge p) \equiv \neg p \vee \neg q
$$
$$
\neg(p \vee q) \equiv \neg p \wedge \neg q
$$
