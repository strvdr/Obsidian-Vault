# 1.1 ~ Definitions and Terminology
### y+5=13, find y => y = 8
 ### y^2 +2y + 1 = 0 => (y+1)^2 = 0 => y = -1

### Ways of Solving Equations:
##### Subtraction
##### Factoring
##### Quadratic Formula
##### Numerical Techniques

# Differential Equations
- dy/dx = x^2 
- y = phi(x) = 1/3x^3 + C 
- y' - y = 0 => y' = y => y = phi(x) = Ce^x
- y'' + y = 0 => y'' = -y => y = phi(x) = asin(x)
### Definition 
[Differential Equations](differential-equations.md) - An equation involving derivatives of one or more functions (aka dependent variables) with respect to one or more independent variables.

	Ex. 1 ~ dy/dx + 5y = e^x or y' + 5y = e^x
	y' and 5y ~ dependent variable
	e^x ~ independent variable
	Ex. 2 ~ u(x, y) = partial^2u/partialx^2 - partial^2u/partialy^2 = 2 partialy/partialx

### Classification by Type
[ODE](ordinary-differential-equations.md) - Ordinary Differential Equation
	- Has only one independent variable and ordinary derivatives
	- F(x,y,y',y'',...,y^n) = 0
		- Only one independent variable (x), y^n is the nth derivative of y. 
[PDE](partial-differential-equation) - Partial Differential Equation 
	- Has two or more independent variables and partial derivatives
