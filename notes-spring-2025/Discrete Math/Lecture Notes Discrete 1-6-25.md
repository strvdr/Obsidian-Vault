## What is Discrete Math?
- Discrete mathematics is the part of mathematics devoted to the study of discrete objects
- More useful: It's the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It is typically used whenever objects are counted, or when relationships between finite (countable) sets are studied. The kind of problems solved using Discrete Math include: 
	- Probability of winning a lottery 
	-
