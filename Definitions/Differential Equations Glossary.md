# Differential Equations

*Differential Equation, DE, DiffEQ*

An equation containing the derivatives of one or more unknown functions (or dependent variables), with respect to one or more independent variables, is said to be a differential equation.

---
# Type

*type*

If a differential equation contains only ordinary derivatives of one or more unknown functions with respect to a single independent variable, it is said to be an ordinary differential equation (ODE). An equation involving partial derivatives of two or more independent variables is called a partial differential equation (PDE).

# Order

*Order*

The order of a differential equation (either ODE or PDE) is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.

---
# Differential Form

*differential form*

$$
M(x,y) dx + N(x,y) dy = 0
$$

---
# Vector

Physics: Vectors are arrows pointing in space. There is a length and a direction.

Computer Science: Vectors are ordered lists of numbers. Good examples of this are arrays.

---
# linear equation

An equation that can be written in the form: 
$$
a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} + \dots + a_{n}x_{n} = b
$$

---
# system of linear equations

*systems of linear equations, linear system*

A collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables

---
# consistent

A system of linear equations is said to be consistent if it has either one solution or infinitely many

---
# inconsistent

A system of linear equations is said to be inconsistent if it has no solutions.

---
# coefficient matrix

with the coefficients of each variable aligned in columns, the following matrix is called the coefficient matrix (matrix of coefficients):
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 \\
0 & 2 & -8 \\
5 & 0 & -5
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---
# augmented matrix

An augmented matrix of a system consists of the coefficient matrix with an added column containing the constants from the right sides of the equations. 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -8 & 8 \\
5 & 0 & -5 & 10 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
